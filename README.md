# TileMaker
Python script to create tiled images from input images. This script takes all images in the directory it is run from and creates tiled output images in a new /tiles subdirectory from them.
The output images contain n x x input images, cropped to the deisred aspect ratio. The crop is centered, retaining as much of the original image as possible.
